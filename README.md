# Roadmap

> #### This Repository will be updated frequently.
## Introduction 

In this roadmap, you will begin your journey to explore four paths and a bootcamp that will greatly contribute to improving your programming skills. By a set of resources and projects to give you a new learning experience! 

These paths and bootcamp are
- High-Level language path
- C++ bootcamp
- Data Structures and algorithms path
- Operating System path
- Network path
- Final Projects path

## Objective
Our objective by the end of this roadmap is to clearly understand the four paths plus the final projects and how to build robust applications that use the concepts we covered.

## Paths
To clearly understand each path, we structured the projects in the following order. 

| Path | Path Shorthand  | Projects Count |
|:-----|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| [High-Level Language](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/high-level-language-path/)| HHL | 12|
| [Data Structure & Algorithms](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/data-structures-and-algorithms-path) | DSA|  22 |
| [Operating System](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/operating-system-path)| OS | 15 |
| [Network](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/network-path/) | NET | 10 |
|   Final Projects   | FP |    3 |
|   Total   | - |  62   | 

> At the end of the roadmap, you will be given 3 **final** projects that combine most or all of the covered paths topics to work on.


## Bootcamps
For each bootcamp, you will have an introduction file linked to the `Bootcamp` field to guide you through the bootcamp journey, and the `Bootcamp Link` field that will have the complete materials and projects related to it.
| Bootcamp | Bootcamp  Shorthand | Bootcamp Link |Projects Count |
|:---------|:------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| [C++](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-introduction-guide) | CPP | [C++ Bootcamp](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-bootcamp) | 0 |
> Before visiting C++ Bootcamp, kindly have a look at the [introduction to C++ Bootcamp](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-introduction-guide) file.

## Submitting Process

* Fork the project repository.
* Make your changes to the project.
* Submit a pull/merge request.

> All questions and concerns regarding the projects are using Github issues.

## Review Status
When a project is due, the project status will be updated as follows.

|     Status       |      Meaning      |
|:------------:|------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ | Submitted|
| ðŸ”´ | Not submitted|
| ðŸŸ  | Late submission |
| ðŸŸ¤ | Submitted, but not implemented correctly |
| ðŸŸ£ | Submission issue |

## Projects Status
The projects are categorized by status as the following. 
|     Status       |      Meaning      |
|:------------|------------|
| Available | The project is available, and you can work on it|
| Not-Available | The project is not yet available|
| Done | The project has passed its submission date|
