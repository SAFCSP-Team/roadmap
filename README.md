# Roadmap

>  This Repository will be updated frequently.
## Introduction 

In this roadmap, you will begin your journey to explore  paths and bootcamps that will greatly contribute to improving your programming skills. By a set of resources and projects to give you a new learning experience! 

These paths and bootcamps are
- High-Level language path
- C++ bootcamp
- Data Structures and algorithms bootcamp
- Operating System path
- Network path
- Final Projects

## Objective
Our objective by the end of this roadmap is to clearly understand the concepts covered, plus the final projects and how to build robust applications with what you learned.

## Paths
To clearly understand each path, we structured the projects in the following order. 

| Path | Shorthand  | Status |
|:-----|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| [High-Level Language](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/high-level-language-path/)| HHL | Done |
| Operating System| OS | Soon |
| Network | NET | Soon |
|   Final Projects   | FP |    Soon |

> At the end of the roadmap, you will be given 3 **final** projects that combine most or all of the covered paths topics to work on.


## Bootcamps
For each bootcamp, you will have an introduction file linked to the `Bootcamp` field to guide you through the bootcamp journey, and the `Bootcamp Link` field that will have the complete materials and projects related to it.
| Bootcamp |  Shorthand |  Link | Status |
|:---------|:------------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| [C++](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-introduction-guide) | CPP | [C++ Bootcamp](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-bootcamp) | Soon |
| [Data Structure & Algorithms](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp) | DSA| [DSA Bootcamp](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp) |**Available**|


<!-- > Before visiting C++ Bootcamp, kindly have a look at the [introduction to C++ Bootcamp](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-introduction-guide) file. -->

## Submitting Process

* Fork the project repository.
* Make your changes to the project.
* Submit a pull/merge request.

> All questions and concerns regarding the projects are using Github issues.

## Review Status
When a project is due, the project status will be updated as follows.

|     Status       |      Meaning      |
|:------------:|------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ | Submitted|
| ðŸ”´ | Not submitted|
| ðŸŸ  | Late submission |
| ðŸŸ¤ | Submitted, but not implemented correctly |
| ðŸŸ£ | Submission issue |

## Projects Status
The projects are categorized by status as the following. 
|     Status       |      Meaning      |
|:------------|------------|
| Available | The project is available, and you can work on it|
| Not-Available | The project is not yet available|
| Done | The project has passed its submission date|
